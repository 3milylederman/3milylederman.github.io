      <p>From IRL fashion shows and club nights to social media and Reddit threads, people are tuning in and dropping out as people turn to the mystical to make sense of the chaotic world around them. While some turn to ancient religions – gnostic symbols, cabbalistic charts and pagan iconography – many online posters are embracing ‘trad-cath’ aesthetics, while others are choosing to see God in the computer. Sometimes it’s a mix. Either way, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that there’s an esoteric spiritualism in the air.</p>

     <p>There are all these ways [in which] the concrete sense of being somewhere has evaporated, and in these gaps run all these idealisms and rumours of God as Because human worldbuilding is hackable, you can throw more weird possibilities and conspiracies and it will actually start producing the sense of another world. </p>

     <p>When paired with the overarching feeling that we can no longer condense the complexities of our feelings into scientific frameworks (for example, the death of therapy-speak) and the poor living conditions of late capitalism, this hyper-networking results in a vibrant experimentalism, where identities are performed and mythologised.</p>

      <p>But at what point does the content stop and the real practice begin? “If it’s just meme play, there’s a point where the rubber does not hit the road,” warns Davis. “Whatever’s animating religious or spiritual practice has to have an element of actual practice with your mind, body and spirit as you interact with the world.” Just as posting memes about touching grass isn’t the same as actually going outside and touching it, no amount of magical thinking will alter the conditions that made us want to transcend the IRL plane to begin with.</p>
